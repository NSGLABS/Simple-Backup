# Simple Backup

Run the install_modules.bat file to install missing modules.

Run the Create Jobs.bat to create the job.

Run Run Jobs.bat to run the backups.


Notes
---
The DBJob.bat and run_DB_job.py are not necessary to run. I needed them in my enviroment and was too lazy to fix it at the time.
